GA SEI-1: Project 1 - Create a game using javascript

## Pre Project Materials:

### Concept Design

Concept, designs, game play ideas.

#### Simon Says!

Do what Simon Says in the order he tells you! A game board of multiple tiles will flash in different colours one at the time. The player has to click on the tiles in the sequence shown to win the round. The rounds will increase in difficulty by showing a longer sequence for the user to replicate and can even include a timer.

#### MVP

When game is run, the game engine will randomly generate a sequence to run on the 4 button tiles. JS will be used to append the class styles to the buttons and set an interval to "light up" the buttons sequentially. 

Afterwards, event listeners will be used to detect the player's moves and then compare it to the generated sequence. 

#### Wireframing

Make a wireframe for each interactive page or element the user will see.
